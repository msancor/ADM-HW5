# Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining - Homework 5

This is a Github repository created to submit the fifth Homework of the **Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining (ADM)** course for the MSc. in Data Science at the Sapienza University of Rome.

--- 
## What's inside this repository?

1. `README.md`: A markdown file that explains the content of the repository.

2. `main.ipynb`: A [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/msancor/ADM-HW5/blob/main/main.ipynb) file containing all the relevant exercises and reports belonging to the homework questions, the *Command Line Question*, and the *Algorithmic Question*.

3. ``modules/``: A folder including 4 Python modules used to solve the exercises in `main.ipynb`. The files included are:

    - `__init__.py`: A *init* file that allows us to import the modules into our Jupyter Notebook.

    - `data_handler.py`: A Python file including a `DataHandler` class designed to handle data cleaning and feature engineering on Kaggle's [Citation Network Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/citation-network-dataset).

    - `backend.py`: A Python file including a `Backend` class designed to build 5 functionalities to solve the exercises from the homework.

    - `frontend.py`: A Python file including a `Frontend` class designed to visualize the 5 functionalities of the `Backend` to solve the exercises from the homework..

4. `commandline.sh`: A bash script including the code to solve the *Command Line Question*.

5. ``.gitignore``: A predetermined `.gitignore` file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a Python project.

6. `LICENSE`: A file containing an MIT permissive license.

## Dataset

In this homework we worked with Kaggle's predefined [Citation Network Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/citation-network-dataset).

## Important Note

If the Notebook doesn't load through Github please try all of these steps:

1. Try compiling the Notebook through its [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/msancor/ADM-HW5/blob/main/main.ipynb).

2. Try downloading the Notebook and opening it in your local computer.
